# Virtual Thrift & Swap Platform with 3D Try-On

---

## 1. Project Title
**Virtual Thrift & Swap Platform with 3D Try-On**

---

## 2. Basic Details

### **Team Name:**  
TechWeavers

### **Team Members:**  
- Devika P Sajith  
- Roshan Roshin
- Pavithra Deepu E
- Ashna Thajudheen 

### **Track / Theme:**  
Sustainable Fashion • AI + Computer Vision • Digital Thrifting

### **Problem Statement:**  
Fast fashion contributes significantly to environmental pollution and leads to a high volume of returns due to improper size and fit. There is no unified digital platform that promotes sustainable clothing reuse and also provides a reliable virtual try-on experience for better decision-making.

### **Solution Overview:**  
A web platform that combines thrift purchasing, barter-based swapping, and an AI-driven 3D virtual try-on system. Users can swap clothes without money, list and buy second-hand fashion, and view real-time 3D fit on a personalized avatar based on their measurements.

### **Brief Project Description:**  
The platform allows users to create a custom 3D avatar based on body measurements and virtually try on clothes before swapping or purchasing. It encourages sustainability, reduces waste, and enhances user confidence when shopping for pre-owned clothing items.
